# Flimly
Flixly is a web app that lets users search movies and TV series and compare where theyâ€™re available across major streaming platforms. It shows availability (subscription, rent, buy, free), pricing, quality, and region, with a Netflix-style UI and hover overlays. Users can sign up, sign in, and directly navigate to watch their chosen title.
