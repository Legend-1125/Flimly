How to Run flixly Locally
1. Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

Node.js (v14+ recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js)

A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

2. Clone the Repository

Clone the project from GitHub to your local machine:

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-folder>

3. Project Structure

Your project folder should have the following structure:

frontend/
├─ home.css
├─ home.js
├─ index.html
├─ signup.html
├─ signin.html
backend/
├─ server.js
├─ users.json      (created automatically after first signup)
├─ movies.json     (sample movie data)
package.json


Descriptions of key files:

frontend/index.html – Main page with search bar and movie list

frontend/home.js – Frontend logic: search, display, navbar, login state

frontend/home.css – Styling for layout, navbar, cards, buttons

frontend/signup.html / signin.html – User authentication pages

backend/server.js – Node.js backend with movie and user API

backend/users.json – Stores user credentials (hashed passwords)

backend/movies.json – Stores movie data for testing/search

4. Install Backend Dependencies

Navigate to your backend folder (or project root if server.js is there) and run:

npm install express bcrypt cors


This will install:

express – Web server framework

bcrypt – Password hashing

cors – Enable cross-origin requests from frontend

5. Run Backend Server

Start the backend server:

node backend/server.js


The server will run on http://localhost:5000

Backend routes available:

POST /signup – Sign up a new user

POST /signin – Sign in an existing user

GET /search?title=<movie_name> – Search for movies by title

6. Open Frontend

You have two options:

Option 1: Open HTML directly

Open frontend/index.html in your web browser.

This works but may have restrictions on some fetch requests in modern browsers.

Option 2: Use a local development server (recommended)

Install a lightweight server (e.g., VS Code Live Server extension) or use npx serve:

cd frontend
npx serve


This will start a server on http://localhost:3000
 (or another port)

Navigate to this URL in your browser to access the site.

7. Using the Website

Sign Up / Sign In

Navigate to Sign Up to create a new account.

Use Sign In to log in with your credentials.

Logged-in users see a welcome message and can log out.

Search Movies

Enter a movie or series title in the search bar.

Click Search to display results from the backend.

Movie Details

Each movie card shows:

Title

Platform

Availability (subscription, rent, buy, free)

Price

Quality

Region

Click Watch on Platform to go to the external link.

8. Adding Sample Data

Populate backend/movies.json with sample movies in the format:

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Inception",
    "platform": "Netflix",
    "availability": "subscription",
    "price": null,
    "quality": ["SD", "HD", "4K"],
    "region": "US",
    "link": "https://www.netflix.com/watch/70131314",
    "poster": "https://image-link.jpg"
  }
]


This enables the search and display functionality.

9. Notes

Backend must be running for search, signup, and signin to work.

Frontend and backend can run on different ports (3000 for frontend, 5000 for backend).

User login state is stored in localStorage in the browser.

Movies and users are persisted in JSON files.
